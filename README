== DESCRIPTION:
  
  * Super basic rule-based parser to match given rules

== Basics
  
  In your class, add your rule definitions
  
  class Car
    include Aska
    attr_accessor :x, :y
    rules <<-EOR
        x > 0
        x > y
        y > 0
      EOR
  end
  
  Then you can see if the rules are matched with the call
  
  @car.rules_valid?
  
  If they do all match, then the rules_valid? will return true, otherwise it will return false

  gem install aska
